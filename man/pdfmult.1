.SH NAME
pdfmult \- puts multiple copies of a PDF page on one page
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdfmult
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIfile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
pdfmult is a command line tool that
rearranges multiple copies of a PDF page (shrunken) on one page.
.PP
The paper size of the produced PDF file is A4,
the input file is also assumed to be in A4 format.
The input PDF file may consist of several pages.
If pdfmult succeeds in obtaining the page count it will rearrange all pages,
if not, only the first page is processed
(unless the page count was specified via command line option).
.PP
pdfmult uses pdflatex with the pdfpages package,
so both have to be installed on the system.
If the \fB\-\-latex\fR option is used, though, pdflatex is not run
and a LaTeX file is created instead of a PDF.
